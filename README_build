Notes on compiling:  psi4 needs gcc version >=4.9, which is not default on even RHEL7 systems (RHEL7 defaults to gcc 4.8.x)
thus need a more recent gcc to compile, install with conda see 
http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_planning.html#faq-modgcc

something like
conda create -n gcc72 gxx_linux-64 gcc_linux-64

then run:
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=~/.conda/envs/gcc72/include/ -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=~/.conda/envs/gcc72/bin/python -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/nv/hp22/jmcdaniel43/data/Programs/psi4/psi4/bin -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${CC} -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CXX} -DOpenMP_LIBRARY_DIRS=~/.conda/envs/gcc72/lib/

where 'build' is build directory

other requirements: ICPC version must be at least 2017.0.0 to work with pybind11 2.1.  Need at least intel/17.0 or higher version if using icc/icpc

for RHEL6

Currently Loaded Modulefiles 
  1) cmake/3.9.1     2) anaconda3/latest    3) mkl/11.0

for RHEL7

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) cmake/3.11.1   2) anaconda3/latest 3) intel/19.0  


found that build breaks if downloading newer versions of pybind, qcelemental, qcengine with anaconda.
Seems that this version of Psi4 breaks with pybind2.4.1.x, use pybind2.3.0
Let Psi4 build the older versions as specified in ./external/upstream/
might have to change the download urls, for instance i put in pybind2.3.0 by changing
external/upstream/pybind11/CMakeLists.txt 
URL https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/archive/v2.3.0.tar.gz
